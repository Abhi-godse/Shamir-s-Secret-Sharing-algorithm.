To run the solution, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Since you cannot use Python, you'll need a different programming environment like Java, C++, JavaScript, or any other supported language you're comfortable with. I’ll guide you through the Java solution, as I provided a sample in the previous messages.

1. Install Java and Set Up IDE
Make sure Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your computer.
Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (you can also use a simple text editor and compile via the terminal).
2. Download/Clone the GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub repository where you’ll store your project.
Clone the repository or create a folder locally where you’ll work on the project.
Step 2: Create the Java Project
Create a new project in your IDE (or a new folder if using a text editor).
Set up your file structure:
Have two files: testcase1.json and testcase2.json.
These files should contain the test cases you shared.

Step 4: Compile and Run the Java Program
If you are using an IDE:

Create the ShamirSecretSharing class in your project.
Make sure you add the testcase1.json and testcase2.json files into the project folder.
Run the program.
If you are using a terminal:

Navigate to your project folder.
Compile the Java file:
bash
Copy code
javac ShamirSecretSharing.java
Run the Java program:
bash
Copy code
java ShamirSecretSharing
Step 5: Push Your Code to GitHub
Once the program is working correctly and producing the expected output, follow these steps to push the code to GitHub:

Initialize Git in your project folder:

bash
Copy code
git init
Add files to the Git repository:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the changes:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit - Shamir Secret Sharing solution"
Push to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Step 6: Submit the Solution
Once the code is pushed to GitHub, submit the link to the repository via the submission form.
